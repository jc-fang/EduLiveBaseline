            In this task, you are asked to watching the live streaming lecture, and make annotations (highlight or ask questions) based on the transcript.
            On the interface, you should be able to see the <b>embedded video on the right</b>, and the <b>real-time transcription on the left</b>.
            <br></br>
            On the <b>left hand side of the transcript</b>, you will see <span style="color:#17a2b8">green vertical bars </span>representing the parts of the transcipt you and your peer learners highlighted.
            Darker green means more people highlighted that sentence.
            Similarly, on the <b>right hand side of the transcript</b>, you will see <span style="color:red"> red vertical bars </span>representing the parts of the transcipt you and your peer learners asked questions based on.
            Darker red means more people asked questions based on that sentence.

            To ask a <b>question</b>, select the corresponding part of the transcript that you don't understand, then click "Question" button above the transcript.
            Type down your question in the pop-up window, then click "Save" when you finish. To help your instructor understand your questions, please make sure
